# opencv-python-demo

Playground for testing the opencv python library.

Currently, text detection is the focus of the project.

## Setup

Install the dependencies via `pip install`.

You will need to download the text detection models and put them in the `models/` directory (you may need to adjust the file names in the code to match the actual file name).

You will also need download your own images and put them in the `images/` directory (again, adjusting file names as necessary).

Then run the code via `python3 main.py`.
